\begin_layout Title
The Maximum Circular Velocity Dependence of Halo Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
The halo model provides a connection between dark matter halos and galaxies,
 and it has been remarkably successful in describing observations of galaxy
 clustering.
 In particular,
\color inherit
 the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) and the Conditional Luminosity Function
 (CLF) are the two most widely used models of the galaxy-halo connection.
 In order to populate halos with galaxies, the HOD gives the probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(N|M)$
\end_inset

 that a halo with mass 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{M}$
\end_inset

 hosts 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 galaxies, while the CLF models the mean abundance 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi(L|M)$
\end_inset

 of galaxies with luminosity 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 which live in a dark matter halo of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 Those two models are convertible that we can obtain an HOD by integrating
 the CLF against luminosity and a CLF by differentiating the HOD with respect
 to luminosity.
 The fundamental assumption in both formalisms is that galaxy occupation
 statistics are characterized entirely by halo mass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some studies show that the most important halo property that influences
 the properties of galaxies within halos is halo mass [White and Rees, 1978
 and one more].
 This is often extended to halo abundance and halo clustering as an assumption
 that halo mass is the most influential halo property to characterize its
 abundance and clustering.
 The motivation behind this assumption comes from the simple excursion set
 formalism, which models halo assembly and clustering from the random walks
 of the density fluctuation, with the assumption that halo environment and
 halo assembly history have no correlation.
 It, however, is shown that the excursion set theory predicts halo clustering
 depends on additional halo environmental factors by relaxing its assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the halo clustering in N-body simulations exhibits dependence
 on halo mass as well as on additional properties such as halo formation
 time [XXX].
 The dependence of halo clustering upon other properties besides halo mass
 is known as halo assembly bias.
 
\color black
There have been several studies showing the correlation between halo formation
 time and environment, and therefore any other properties that depend on
 formation time or environment (such as concentration, spin, and velocity
 anisotropy) affect to the assembly bias.
 If the galaxy properties in halos are affected by halo environment, it
 implies that the galaxy occupation statistics also correlate with halo
 assembly bias.
 Several groups study the correlation between galaxy formation and halo
 assembly bias both theoretically (Croton et al.
 2007) and observationally (XXX).
 Even though 
\color red
Ref.
 XXX[Croton et al.
 2007]
\color black
 shows the significant influence of halo assembly bias on galaxy clustering,
 there have been mixed responses to the detection of such a correlation
 observationally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a response to halo assembly bias, a recent trend in connecting halos
 and galaxies has been to use the Abundance Matching technique.
 In the Abundance Matching technique, a monotonic relation between galaxy
 luminosity and the maximum circular velocities of halos is assumed so that
 one can assign the most luminous galaxy to the halo which have the largest
 maximum circular velocity and repeat the same procedure in a hierarchical
 manner.
 The motivation behind the technique is that the maximum circular velocity,
 which is a measure of the halos' potential well depth, correlates strongly
 with stellar mass of the galaxies and also generically predicts assembly
 bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we explore the additional dependence of galaxy clustering
 on the central velocity dispersion both on small and large scales.
 In Section 2, we briefly describe the simulations, halo finding algorithm,
 and identification of halo types.
 In Section 3, we compare halo clustering for samples which we select halos
 so that we can purely account for the maximum circular dependence of halo
 clustering.
 We also investigate the effect of ejected halos on the halo clustering.
 The ejected halos are the halos which were within the virial radius of
 more massive host halos in the past but identified as a distinguished halo
 at present epoch.
 There have been several studies discussing the possibilities that those
 ejected halos are not host halos but subhalos [
\color red
XXX: Wetzel et al.
 14, and some other references for backsplash radius...are there any better
 ways to phrase and also connect this to backsplash radius?
\color inherit
].
 So, it is crucial to explore how distnction of halo types affect to halo
 clustering.
 In Section4, we explore how the Abundance Matching techniques based on
 halo mass and the maximum circular velocity make qualitatively different
 predictions for the clustering of central galaxies to connect our findings
 in Section 3 to observations.
 In Section 5, we discuss the implications of our results and summarize
 our main conlusions.

\begin_layout Section
The Simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use cosmological N-body simulations called the Bolshoi simulation [XXX:http:/
/arxiv.org/abs/1002.3660 (Klypin, Trujillo-Gomez, and Primack, 2011)] and
 the MultiDark simulation [XXX: http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0003 (Riebe et al.,
 2012), Prada et al.
 2011] to investigate the maximum circular velocity dependence of halo clusterin
g.
 We use both simulations in order to obtain a large dynamic mass range.
 Both simulations assume a flat 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$
\end_inset

 model with density parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{m}=0.27$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{b}=0.0469$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{8}=0.82$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0.95$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0.70$
\end_inset

.
 The Bolshoi simulation uses 
\begin_inset Formula $2048^{3}$
\end_inset

 particles in a periodic box with side length 
\begin_inset Formula $250h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

.
 The mass of each particle is 
\begin_inset Formula $1.35\times10^{8}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 with the force resolution 
\begin_inset Formula $1h^{-1}{\rm kpc}$
\end_inset

.
 The MultiDark simulation uses 
\begin_inset Formula $2048^{3}$
\end_inset

 particles in a periodic box with side length 
\begin_inset Formula $1000h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

.
 The mass of each particle is 
\begin_inset Formula $8.721\times10^{9}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 with the force resolution 
\begin_inset Formula $7h^{-1}{\rm kpc}$
\end_inset

.
 The simulations were run with the Adaptive Refinement Tree Code [ART: Kravtsov
 et al.
 1997, Gottloeber & Klypin 2008].
 Halo catalogues and snapshots for dark matter particles are available at

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use halo catalogues generated by the ROCKSTAR, which is a phase-space,
 temporal halo finder [XXX].
 The ROCKSTAR identifies halos and subhalos down to the maximum circular
 velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}\thicksim55{\rm km/s}$
\end_inset

 and also provides merger trees.
 Those catalogues are publicly available at 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the halo catalogue, we classify halos into three different categories:
 host halo, subhalos, and ejected halos.
 Host halos are the halos that have never been within the virial radius
 of more massive halos.
 Subhalos are the halos which are within the virial radius of more massive
 halos at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 Ejected halos, sometimes called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

backsplash
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 halos, are the distinct halos at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 whose main progenitors passed through the virial radius of a more massive
 halos at least once in the past.
 In order to identify ejected halos, we build a merger tree by using a merger
 tree algorithm CONSISTENT TREES[cite].
 In later sections, when we say halos without any specifications, we include
 both host halos and ejected halos.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dark matter halos in the halo catalogue at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 are defined to be spherical regions whose average density equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{{\rm h}}\rho_{{\rm crit}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{{\rm h}}=360$
\end_inset


\color black
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 according to Bryan & Norman fitting function for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$
\end_inset

 cosmology [XXX] and whose radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}=4\pi\Omega_{m}\rho_{{\rm crit}}\Delta_{{\rm h}}R_{{\rm vir}}^{3}/3$
\end_inset

.
 Note that even though subhalos are distinct and bound objects within the
 host halos, the masses and radii of subhalos do not follow the above virial
 definition, because their structures are strongly affected by the potentials
 of their host halos.
 In order to define the maximum circular velocity for each halo, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{{\rm G}M(r)/r}$
\end_inset

 within the radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is repeatedly computed with increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $r<R_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 until finding the maximum value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the sake of the internal structure of halos to be resolved well enough,
 we made a conservative cut in mass and maximum circular velocity.
 We use halos whose mass is greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{12}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $>100$
\end_inset

 particles per halo) and whose maximum circular velocity is greater than
 
\begin_inset Formula $200{\rm km/s}$
\end_inset

 for the MultiDark simulation, and halos whose mass is greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{11}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $>740$
\end_inset

 particles per halo) and whose maximum circular velocity is greater than
 
\begin_inset Formula $95{\rm km/s}$
\end_inset

 for the Bolshoi simulation.
 
\color red
Those values correspond to the peak in the number of halos by binning them
 as a function of mass and maximum circular velocity.
 
\color inherit
The halo samples below the halo mass or maximum circular velocoty corresponding
 to the peak are not considered to be complete based on the predictions
 for halo mass functions, which are a monotonically increasing function
 with the decrease in halo mass.
 As we will see in Section 3, simultaneous dependence of halo clustering
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

, the cut is not enough.
 But all the results pass this cut unless it is noted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Maximum Circular Velocity Dependence of Halo Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we investigate the maximum circular velocity dependence
 of halo clustering on both large and small scales.
 We first start with an analytic expression of the maximum circular velocity
 computed from the halo mass and its concentration.
 Then, we explain how we select halos for each sample to remove the halo
 mass dependence using the analytic expression of the maximum circular velocity.
 Finally, we show how halo biases differ for those samples both on large
 scales and small scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Maximum Circular Velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compute the maximum circular velocity for halos, we assume that
 dark matter halos are defined as a spherical halo with a virial radius.
 Those halos have average density equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{{\rm h}}\rho_{{\rm crit}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{{\rm h}}=360$
\end_inset

 
\color red
for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 according to Bryan & Norman fitting function [XXX]
\color inherit
.
 We also assume that those spherical halos have an NFW density profile (XXX).
 Then, the maximum circular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 as a function of the halo mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 and its concentration 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}=0.465M_{{\rm vir}}^{1/3}\sqrt{G(\frac{4}{3}\pi\Delta_{{\rm h}}\rho_{{\rm crit}}\Omega_{m})^{1/3}\frac{c}{{\rm ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)}}}.\label{eq:vmax-mvir}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The median concentration-mass relation at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 obtained from the Bolshoi simulation in Ref.
 XXX(Klypin et al.
 2011) is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\rm log}_{10}c=-0.097{\rm log_{10}M_{vir}}+2.148.\label{eq:concen}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\color black
By using the above median concentration to Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:vmax-mvir"

\end_inset

, we obtain a one to one mapping between the virial halo mass and its maximum
 circular velocity, denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 hereafter.

\color inherit
 Given this mapping, we can translate clustering measurements as a function
 of halo mass into predicted clustering measurements as a function of maximum
 circular velocity.
 Our goal below is to determine whether this conversion describes the measured
 clustering or if there is a residual dependence on the maximum circular
 velocity.

To begin with, we split the sample of halos described in Section 2 into
 a sequence of virial mass bins from high mass to low mass, chosen such

 We select 200000 halos for each bin for the halo sample from the MultiDark
 simulation and 25000 halos for the Bolshoi simulation.
 
\color inherit
This process is reminiscent of an abundance matching procedure (cite XXX).
 We then further split each bin into two subsamples with their observed

almost equal for any halo mass bins.
 This selection ensures that both the upper and lower subsamples have the
 same mean halo mass.
 Therefore, in the absence of an additional 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 dependence on clustering, these samples should have the same clustering
 properties.

\color red
 Note that this would not be true if we had simply split the sample along
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

, since the two resulting subsamples would have different mean halo masses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Halo Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure halo biases, we first compute halo-matter cross correlation
 functions for each subsample.
 We used cross correlation functions to reduce the shot noise effect on
 the error.
 Here, instead of using full DM particles, we subsample 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 particles to compute the cross correlation functions and matter auto correlatio
n functions.
 Then, we define a linear bias: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b_{{\rm lin}}=\sum_{i}(\xi_{hm}(r_{i})/\xi_{mm}(r_{i}))/N_{{\rm bin}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{hm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{mm}$
\end_inset

 are halo-matter and matter-matter correlation functions and we take the
 average of the ratio on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $20h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

, which contains 20 bins in total.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 and

 For large halo masses, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples have larger linear biases than the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples.
 This result is consistent with the result discussed in Ref.
 XXX(Dalal et al.
 2008).
 For low halo masses, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples have larger linear biases than the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples.
 Those halos, which have larger maximum circular velocities than 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

, are the ones which are supposed to grow into larger mass halos, but somehow
 the mass growth is suppressed due to a tidal field [XXX: Wang et al.
 + Wetzel et al.
 2014].
 This is why those halos in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples cluster more strongly than the ones in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples.
 As halo mass decreases, the difference in linear bias between the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples increases up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim40\%$
\end_inset

.
 On the low mass end, there is a drop in the ratio of the linear biases.
 As we see no physical reasons, consider that this is a resolution effect
 and suggest that the condition required for completeness is more stringent
 [XXX: Peter's paper].

 Ejected halos, however, are halos which were identified as part of more
 massive halos at one or more occasions in the past, but were ejected and
 now exist at a host halo at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 Those ejected halos tend to exist around more massive halos (any reference?),
 and only some of them may be gravitationally bound to other more massive
 halos.
 Therefore, the effect on scale-dependent biases may be caused by those
 ejected halos.
 To test this, we compute halo-matter cross correlation functions without
 the ejected halos.
 Similar to Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we first compare linear biases as a function of halo mass.
 We observe that the ratios of linear biases between the

 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 only shows the results for low mass halos from
\color black
 the Bolshoi simulation.
 This is because
\color inherit
 we do not find many ejected halos in the MultiDark simulation due to its
 mass resolution.
 
\color black
Once the ejected halos have been removed, the deviation of the halo bias
 on small scales is greatly reduced.
 
\color inherit
This implies an intimate connection between assembly bias and subhalo back-splas
hing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude that halos which have different 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 cluster differently even when those halos have the same virial mass.
 In particular, the scale-dependence of halo biases on small scales is significa
ntly different, which is mainly caused by the ejected halos.

Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we demonstrate 
\color black
possible observational relevances of the results in the previous section
 to complement the halo theory results.
 
\color inherit
We start with the abundance matching (citation?) technique based on halo
 mass and the maximum circular velocity which may make qualitatively different
 predictions for clustering of central galaxies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Mvir-based v.s.
 Vmax-based
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In abundance matching, we assume a monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity
 and one of the halo properties which represent the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

size
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of halos and assign the most luminous galaxy to the largest halo in a hierarchi
cal manner so that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{g}(>L)=n_{h}(>M_{{\rm vir}}/V_{{\rm max}})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{g}(>L)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{h}(>M_{{\rm vir}}/V_{{\rm max}})$
\end_inset

 are the number density of galaxies and halos which have larger luminosity
 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 or halo mass/the maximum circular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}/V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 The practical procedure is following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) Rank order halos by 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) Select 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 halos for each bin from high to low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we only use halo sample from the Bolshoi simulation and
 select 25000 halos for each bin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
, we want to identify what kind of physical properties characterize halo
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

size
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As a first step, we explore how the abundance matching based on halo mass
 and maximum circular velocity influence halo clustering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the previous section, we compute halo-matter cross correlation
 functions for the abundance matched samples by splitting halos into a sequence
 of halo mass bins, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{n}(M_{{\rm vir}})$
\end_inset

, and the maximum circular velocity bins, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{n}(V_{{\rm max}})$
\end_inset

, chosen such that each bin has the same number of halos.
 We observe that when we include ejected halos, the linear biases for the
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

-samples are larger than the ones for the 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

-samples by 5%, while the difference in linear biases is suppressed to 2%
 by excluding ejected halos.
 This result is consistent with the result in Sec.
 3.2.
 The magnitude of the difference, however, is smaller than the cases of
 splitting the samples based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also compare the cross correlation functions on small scales.
 Figure

 displays data in the same way as Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 with the ejected halos on the left and without the ejected halos on the
 right.
 When those samples contain ejected halos, the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

-samples show very different scale-dependence on halo bias than the 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

-samples do.
 This scale-dependent feature becomes stronger as halo mass decreases.
 Without ejected halos, the difference on small-scale biases between the
 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

- and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

- samples is reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5\%$

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous studies show the dependencies of halo clustering on other parameters
 besides halo mass and how those dependencies affect on observations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We explore the dependency of clustering on the maximum circular velocity
 and how it makes difference on observations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that halo clustering depends on the maximum circular velocity both
 on large and small scales.
 Our finding for the clustering on large scales is consistent with the result
 in Dalal et al.
 2008.The dependence of the clustering on small scales is mostly due to backsplas
h halos.
 This is first time to show how the backsplash halos affect the clustering
 on small scales.
 It suggests that the backsplash halos should be treated as subhalos and
 not as host halos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limitations of my study is that we did not investigate whether those
 backsplash halos are actually gravitationally bound to more massive halos
 which are close to those backsplash halos.
 Also, at this point, we are not sure whether all backsplash halos should
 be treated as subhalos or some subclasses of backsplash halos are subhalos.
