\begin_layout Title
The Maximum Circular Velocity Dependence of Halo Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
The halo model
\color inherit
 has been remarkably successful in describing observations of galaxy clustering.
 In particular, the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) and the Conditional
 Luminosity Function (CLF) have been widely used to constrain not only the
 galaxy-halo connection [XXX] but also cosmology [XXX].
 The fundamental assumption in both formalisms is that galaxy occupation
 statistics only depends on halo mass.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spatial distribution of dark matter (DM) halos in N-body simulations,
 however, exhibits dependence on halo mass as well as on additional properties
 such as halo formation time [XXX].
 The dependence of halo clustering upon other properties besides halo mass
 known as halo assembly bias.
 
\color blue
There have been several studies showing the correlation between halo formation
 time and environment, and therefore any other properties which depends
 on formation time or environment (such as concentration, spin, and velocity
 anisotropy) affect to the assembly bias.
 This assembly bias violates the standard HOD/CLF assumption and also questions
 how these model can predict the clustering statistics of galaxies correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a response to halo assembly bias, recent trend in the way to populate
 galaxies has been to use the Abundance Matching technique based on the
 maximum circular velocities of halos.
 The motivation behind use of the maximum circular velocity is that it depends
 only on the central part of the halo potential (i.e., potentially more closely
 related to galaxy formation) and sets early in the growth of the halo [XXX:
 Frank's paper] (i.e., more robust to disruption in mergers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we explore the dependence of galaxy clustering on the central
 velocity dispersion both on small and large scales.
 We show that some of the features on small scales in a detailed halo model
 come from the effects of back-splash halos, which is one of the categories
 of halos classified based on the halo merger tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use cosmological N-body simulations called the Bolshoi simulation and
 the MultiDark simulation, described in XXX and XXX respectively, to investigate
 the maximum circular velocity dependence of halo clustering.
 The Bolshoi simulation uses 
\begin_inset Formula $2048^{3}$
\end_inset

 particles with a volume of 
\begin_inset Formula $(250$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

, while the MultiDark simulation uses the same number of particles as the
 Bolshoi simulation but with a volume of (
\begin_inset Formula $1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Both simulations assumes a flat 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$
\end_inset

 model with density parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{m}=0.27$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{b}=0.0469$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{8}=0.82$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0.95$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0.70$
\end_inset

.
 The details of the simulations are described in XXX.
 We use both simulations to get a large dynamic mass range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For halo identification, we use the ROCKSTAR halo finder (XXX) where the
 halo masses and maximum circular velocities are computed from bound particles.
 For the sake of the internal structure of halos to be resolved well enough,
 we make a conservative cut in mass and maximum circular velocity.
 We use halos whose mass is greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{12}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $>100$
\end_inset

 particles per halo) and whose maximum circular velocity is greater than
 
\begin_inset Formula $200{\rm km/s}$
\end_inset

 for the MultiDark simulation, and halos whose mass is greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{11}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $>740$
\end_inset

 particles per halo) and whose maximum circular velocity is greater than
 
\begin_inset Formula $95{\rm km/s}$
\end_inset

 for the Bolshoi simulation.
 Those values correspond to the peak in the number of halos by binning them
 as a function of mass and maximum circular velocity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the merger tree, we can classify halos into three different categories:
 host halo, subhalos, and ejected halos.
 Host halos are the halos which have never been within the virial radius
 of more massive halos.
 Subhalos are the halos which are within the virial radius of more massive
 halos at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 Ejected halos, sometimes called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

backsplash
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 halos, are the distinct halos at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 whose main progenitors passed through the virial radius of a more massive
 halos at least once in the past.
 In later sections, when we say halos without any specifications, we include
 both host halos and ejected halos.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Maximum Circular Velocity Dependence of Halo Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we investigate the maximum circular velocity dependence
 of halo clustering on both large and small scales.
 We first start with an analytic expression of the maximum circular velocity
 computed from the halo mass and its concentration.
 Then, we explain how we select halos for each sample to remove the halo
 mass dependence using the analytic expression of the maximum circular velocity.
 Finally, we show how halo biases differ for those samples both on large
 scales and small scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Maximum Circular Velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compute the maximum circular velocity for halos, we assume that
 dark matter halos are defined as a spherical halo with a virial radius.
 Those halos have average density equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{{\rm h}}\rho_{{\rm crit}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{{\rm h}}=360$
\end_inset

 for the MultiDark and Bolshoi simulations.
 We also assume that those spherical halos have an NFW density profile (XXX).
 Then, the maximum circular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 as a function of the halo mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 and its concentration 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}=0.465M_{{\rm vir}}^{1/3}\sqrt{G(\frac{4}{3}\pi\Delta_{{\rm h}}\rho_{{\rm crit}}\Omega_{m})^{1/3}\frac{c}{{\rm ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)}}}.\label{eq:vmax-mvir}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The median concentration-mass relation at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 obtained from the Bolshoi simulation in Ref.
 XXX(Klypin et al.
 2011) is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\rm log}_{10}c=-0.097{\rm log_{10}M_{vir}}+2.148.\label{eq:concen}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\color black
By using the above median concentration to Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:vmax-mvir"

\end_inset

, we obtain a one to one mapping between the virial halo mass and its maximum
 circular velocity, denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 hereafter.

\color inherit
 Given this mapping, we can translate clustering measurements as a function
 of halo mass into predicted clustering measurements as a function of maximum
 circular velocity.
 Our goal below is to determine whether this conversion describes the measured
 clustering or if there is a residual dependence on the maximum circular
 velocity.

\begin_layout Standard
We first split the sample into a sequence of virial mass bins, chosen such
 that there are the same numbers of halos in each bin.
 This process is reminiscent of an abundance matching procedure (cite XXX).
 We then further split each bin into two subsamples with their observed
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,obs}}$

 are 
\color inherit
almost equal for any halo mass bins.
 This selection ensures that both the upper and lower subsamples have the
 same mean halo mass.
 Therefore, in the absence of an additional 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 dependence on clustering, these samples should have the same clustering
 properties.
 Note that this would not be true if we had simply split the sample along
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

, since the two resulting subsamples would have different mean halo masses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Halo Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure halo biases, we first compute halo-matter cross correlation
 functions for each subsample.
 We use cross correlation functions to reduce the shot noise effect on the
 error.
 Here, instead of using full DM particles, we subsample 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 particles to compute the cross correlation functions and matter auto correlatio
n functions.
 Then, we define a linear bias: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b_{{\rm lin}}=\sum_{i}(\xi_{hm}(r_{i})/\xi_{mm}(r_{i}))/N_{{\rm bin}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{hm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{mm}$
\end_inset

 are halo-matter and matter-matter correlation functions and we take the
 average of the ratio on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $20h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

, which contains 20 bins in total.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows linear biases as a function of halo mass by splitting each sample

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples.
 For large halo masses, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples have larger linear biases than the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples.
 This result is consistent with the result discusses in Ref.
 XXX(Dalal et al.
 2008).
 For low halo masses, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples have larger linear biases than the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples.
 Those halos which have larger maximum circular velocities than 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 are the ones which are supposed to grow into larger mass halos, but somehow
 the mass growth is suppressed.
 This is why those halos in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples cluster more strongly than the ones in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples.
 As halo mass decreases, the difference in linear bias between the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples increases up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim40\%$
\end_inset

.
 On low mass end, there is a drop in the ratio of the linear biases.
 We think that the drop is due to mass resolution of the simulation.

 Furthermore, the difference on small scales becomes larger for lower halo

\color red

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up to now, we use both host halos and ejected halos to compute halo biases.
 Both types of halos are identified as distinct halos at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 Ejected halos, however, are halos which were identified as a part of a
 more massive halos at one or more occasions in the past.
 Those ejected halos tend to exist around a more massive halos (any reference?),
 and only some of them may be gravitationally bound to other more massive
 halos.
 Therefore, the efect on the scale-dependent biases may be caused by those
 ejected halos.
 To test this, we compute halo-matter cross correlation functions without
 the ejected halos.
 Similar to Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This is because
\color inherit
 we do not find many ejected halos in the MultiDark simulation due to its
 mass resolution.
 
\color black
Once the ejected halos have been removed, the deviation of the halo bias
 on small scales is greatly reduced.
 
\color inherit
This implies an intimate connection between assembly bias and subhalo back-splas
hing.

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude that halos which have different

 cluster differently even when those halos have the same virial mass.
 In particular, the scale-dependence of halo biases on small scales is significa

In abundance matching, we link galaxy populations to halo populations by
 assuming that big galaxies live in big halos in a hierarchical manner.
 The question is what

 To rank order halos, we want to identify what kind of physical properties
 characterize halo

 As a first step, we explore how the abundance matching based on halo mass
 and maximum circular velocity influence halo clustering.
\end_layout

Similar to the previous section, we compute halo-matter cross correlation
 functions for the abundance matched samples by splitting halos into a sequence

 We observe that when we include ejected halos, the linear biases for the

 by excluding ejected halos.
 This result is consistent with the result in Sec.
 3.2.
 The magnitude of the difference, however, is smaller than the cases of
 splitting the samples based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{V}_{{\rm max}}$

 with the ejected halos on the left and without the ejected halos on the
 right.
 When those samples contain ejected halos, the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

-samples show very different scale-dependence on halo bias than the 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

-samples do.
 This scale-dependent feature becomes stronger as halo mass decreases.
 Without ejected halos, the difference on small-scale biases between the
 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

- and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

- samples is reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5\%$

\end_inset

-based and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

-based abundance matching samples with ejected halos (left) and without
 ejected halos (right).
 The ratios are normalized by their linear biases.
 Each line corresponds to different halo mass bins labeled in the plots.
 With ejected halos, the halo biases computed from the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

-samples have very different scale-dependence than the ones from the 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

-samples.
 By removing those ejected halos, the difference is more or less removed.

 Use Peter Behroozi's stellar-to-halo mass relation to estimate the stellar
 mass of the central galaxy that would be found in these halos, then plot
 the halo-matter cross-correlation as a function of scale, over-plotting
 the two results.

--want to show: We show that the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal of low-mass
 centrals is impacted at the xxx-yyy% level, in a highly scale-dependent
 fashion, by the theoretical choice to empirically connect stellar mass
 to either host halo Vmax or Mvir.
