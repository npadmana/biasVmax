\begin_layout Section
The Simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use cosmological N-body simulations called the Bolshoi simulation and
 the MultiDark simulation, described in XXX and XXX respectively, to investigate
 the maximum circular velocity dependence of halo clustering.
 The Bolshoi simulation uses 
\begin_inset Formula $2048^{3}$
\end_inset

 particles with a volume of 
\begin_inset Formula $(250$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

, while the MultiDark simulation uses the same number of particles as the
 Bolshoi simulation but with a volume of (
\begin_inset Formula $1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Both simulations assumes a flat 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$
\end_inset

 model with density parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{m}=0.27$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{b}=0.0469$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{8}=0.82$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0.95$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0.70$
\end_inset

.
 (??Do I need to put a name for each constant?)The details of the simulations
 are described in XXX.
 For halo identification, we use the ROCKSTAR halo finder (XXX) where the
 halo masses and maximum circular velocities are computed from bound particles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
??Should I explain more about what bound particles mean (though my understanding
 is vague...) and am not so sure what other ways to define masses and circular
 velocity and also how the definitions can make things different...

??What other information do I need to put here?

\begin_layout Section
The Maximum Circular Velocity Dependence of Halo Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we investigate the maximum circular velocity dependence
 of halo clustering on both large and small scales.
 In order to do that, we compute correlation functions and measre halo biases
 for halo samples having different maximum circular velocities.
 We first describe how we select halos for each sample and then show how
 those samples have different clustering properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vmax-mvir"

\end_inset

, the maximum circular velocity and halo mass has tight correlation, and
 yet the scatter between the maximum circular velocity and halo mass becomes
 larger with decreasing halo masses.
 In fact, we can compute an expected maximum circular velocity from halo
 mass
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{{\rm max}}=0.465M_{{\rm vir}}^{1/3}\sqrt{G(\frac{4}{3}\pi\Delta_{{\rm h}}\rho_{{\rm crit}}\Omega_{m})^{1/3}\frac{c}{{\rm ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)}}},\label{eq:vmax-mvir}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 is the maximum circular velocity and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 is the halo mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is the gravitational constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{{\rm h}}$
\end_inset

 is XXX, and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the concentration parameter.
 To obtain Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:vmax-mvir"

\end_inset

, we use the concentration of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\rm log}_{10}c=-0.097{\rm log_{10}M_{vir}}+2.148.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

(??Ask Frank how he obtain this concentration value and why this is a reasonable
 value)

\end_inset

, this 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}-M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 relation with the above concentration (shown as a red solid line) intersects
 the peak of the distribution, which means that many of the halos follow
 this relation.

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, the above equation is a one to one mapping between the virial
 mass of the halo and its maximum circular velocity.
 Given this mapping, we can translate clustering measurements as a function
 of halo mass into predicted clustering measurements as a function of maximum
 circular velocity.
 Our goal below is to determine whether this conversion describes the measured
 clustering or if there is a residual dependence on the maximum circular
 velocity.
 In order to explore this, we first split the sample into a sequence of
 virial mass bins, chosen such that there are the same numbers of halos
 in each bin.
 This process is reminiscent of an abundance-matching procedure (cite XXX).
 We then further split each bin into two subsamples with their observed
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,obs}}$
\end_inset

 greater than (denoted by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) or less than (denoted as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}(M_{{\rm vir}})$
\end_inset

.
 This selection ensures that both the upper and lower subsamples have the
 same mean halo mass.
 Therefore, in the absence of an additional 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 dependence (??isn't this 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 dependence?) on clustering, these samples should have the same clustering
 properties.
 Note that this would not be true if we had simply split the sample along
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

, since the two resulting subsamples would have different mean halo masses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure halo biases, we compute halo-matter cross correlation
 functions for each subsample and measure a linear bias 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b_{lin}=<\xi_{hm}(r)/\xi_{mm}(r)>,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{hm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{mm}$
\end_inset

 are halo-matter and matter-matter correlation functions and we take the
 average of the ratio on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $20h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 (??may change to jackknife samplings).
 Here, instead of using full DM particles, we subsample 
\begin_inset Formula $1000000$
\end_inset

 particles to compute matter auto correlation functions.
 The reason we use cross correlation functions is to reduce the shot noise
 effect on the error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:linear-bias"

\end_inset

, we show how linear biases depend on the maximum circular velocity as a
 function of halo mass.
 We compute linear biases for each mass bin classifying into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 maximum circular velocity halos.
 The halos which have different maximum circular velocity clearly cluster
 differently.
 Furthermore, the relative bias of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 versus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subsamples increases with decreasing halo mass to almost 40% on low mass
 end.

 mass end? is it real or srtificial?

In Fig.

, we investigate the maximum circular velocity dependence of halo bias on
 small scales.
 On small scales, a halo bias is scale-dependent.
 The question here is whether halos with different maximum circular velocity
 have dierent scale-dependence on their biases.
 In order to nd that, we take the ratio of halo-matter cross correlation
 functions between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

upper" and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower" subsamples and normalize it by their linear biases.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 clearly shows that the scale-dependence depends on the maximum circular
 velocity and its Vmax-dependence is mass-dependent.
 As halo mass decreases, the relative scale-dependence between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper" and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

lower" subsamples increases, especially halos with large maximum circular
 velocities heavily clustered around

 reasons?
